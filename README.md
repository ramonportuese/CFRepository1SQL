This school project is based off of fictional data and a fictional company called Rockbuster Stealth LLC "Rockbuster." 
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that use to have brick and mortar stores all across
the world.  Recently however, the company has been battling competition from streaming services such as
Netflix, Hulu, and many more.  The management team at Rockbuster Stealth is pivoting and making a change to more 
online streaming services rather than just brick and mortar stores.  

My role as a data analyst for this company is to load all of the Rockbuster data into a Relational Database Managment System
(RDBMS) and help the company make good data driven dections.  These decisions are made by a practical use of SQL to analyze the data
and answer all ad-hoc business questions that arise.  Tableau was also used to help presend the data visualizations.  
Ultimately I ended up presenting these findings to my fictional Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.
