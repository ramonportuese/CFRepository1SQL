This school project is based off of fictional data and a fictional company called Rockbuster Stealth LLC "Rockbuster." 
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that use to have brick and mortar stores all across
the world.  Recently however, the company has been battling competition from streaming services such as
Netflix and Hulu.  The management team at Rockbuster Stealth is pivoting and making a change to more 
online streaming services rather than just brick and mortar stores.  

My role as a data analyst for this company is to load all of the Rockbuster data into a Relational Database Managment System
(RDBMS)  and help the company make good data driven dections.  These decisions are made by a practical use of SQL to analyze the data
and answer all ad-hoc business questions that arise.  Ultimately I ended up presenting these findings to my fictional Rockbuster Stealth
Management Board. 

Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.
You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI)
department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries. Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
Before you can begin your analysis and answer more complex business questions, you’ll
need to acquire a good understanding of the various data points. You’ll eventually compile
the results of your analysis into an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the
Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.
